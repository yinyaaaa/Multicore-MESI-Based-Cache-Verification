# Multicore-MESI-Based-Cache-Verification
Write a Verification plan to create UVCs including virtual sequencers, driver, monitor, scoreboard, etc.
• According to the verification plan, using SystemVerilog and UVM to verify the Multicore Cache system with MESI cache coherency protocol and pseudo-LRU replacement policy.
• Using SystemVerilog to Write assertions for checking and run regression to expose bugs.
• Using VManger platform to target functional coverage at 100% and code coverage at 97%
• Write a bug report to demonstrate 10 bugs in the design with clear annotation and map it with verification plan.
